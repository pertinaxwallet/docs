From the business plan of Pavel Durov, it follows that Telegram as a messenger is the first phase of a more global project, and was created mainly to form a huge customer base. As TON develops, the messenger itself will become just one of its applications, so in 2021 it is planned to rebrand Telegram Open Network into The Open Network, and the Telegram brand will remain with the messenger.
